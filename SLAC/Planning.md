# Planning
> A high-level overview of the different phases involved in planning a hackathon at college

## Step 1. Setup a hackathon commitee

- All final decisions must rest within the hands of the club mentor

## Step 2. Choose a tentative theme

- Brainstorm with the entire hackathon commitee

## Step 3. Begin scouting for sponsors

- Make a list of potential sponsors
- Two types of sponsors usually
  - Monetary Sponsors
    - Provide money to support the hackathon
    - These funds usually form the bigger chunk of the prize money
    - Example: We have had GE, Honeywell, CSI, ACM etc. in the past SLACs
    - Creative Tim provided Frontend themes worth 500$ each to the winning teams in SLAC 2018-19. That's also a kind of monetary sponsorship
  - Swag Kit Sponsors
    - Provide stickers, badges and other goodies
    - These help maintain the fun and FREE stuff element of the hackathon
    - Example: We have had Github as a main Swag sponsor for the last 4 SLACs
  - Platform Sponsors
    - Provide an online platform for the hackathon
    - Example: We have had Skillenza in the past(SLAC 2018-19)
  - Start this early
  - Make a BIG database of all potential sponsors
    
## Step 4. Prepare a format for the hackathon

- Theme?
- Prizes?
- Registration Fee?
- Opportunities?
- Mini-events?
- Timeline of events?
- Submission?
- Evaluation?
- and many more...

## Step 5. Prepate a rough budget

- Usually, this is based on past years' hackathons
- But, feel free to start afresh
- Main things to consider with regards to the budget
  - Prize money
  - Design and print
  - Decorations for the labs
  - Food for participants? (Never happened at SLAC before!)
  - Emergency fund

## Step 6. Official pitch to the college

- Discuss with the CSE department and the college administration
- Discuss about the budget and the support college can provide
- Be sure to be very clear about everything before going ahead

## Step 7. Design stage I

- Start designing the publicity material for the hackathon
- Make a dedicated team for this
- Designs include, but not limited to
  - Brochure
    - One for potential sponsors
    - One for college invites
  - Sponsor Presentation Deck
    - Should answer "Why a sponsor should put in their money in SLAC?"
    - Should be self-explanatory, but don't overwhelm with text
  - FACE Presentation Deck
    - Some organizations might want to see how legit the club is
    - So, prepare an honest deck of all the cool stuff that was done in the past!
  - FACE Hype Poster 1
    - The "Coming Soon" poster at college and for social media
   - FACE Website
    - Get this ready with all relevant details including sponsorship tiers, format, theme etc.
    
## Step 8. Approach sponsors

- Use the previous sponsorship database and start sending out mails with relevant material
- Send the mails in batches
- Respond to queries or responses within 12 hours
- Be honest and open to the sponsors about how many sposnors you have, what your budget is etc.

## Step 9. Talk to Seniors

- Have an idea of how things are supposed to happen during SLAC

## Step 10. Design stage II

- By now, the sponsorship has to be fixed
- Brochures for colleges
- Social media posters
- Memes
- Teaser videos
- SLAC Banner
- Anything else you think is necesssary to market SLAC

**Quick Fact:** Do not overly on "other" clubs to design for you. In SLAC 2018-19, all designs were done in Canva and it's fairly easy to do so. Be as independent as possible.

## Step 11. Publicize

- Invite colleges
- Social media publicizing
- Run early-bird offers on the registration tickets
- Anything else that is important

## Step 12. Consider workshops

- Not everybody will "build" something. You don't want these students to get bored.
- Try to arrange workshops from external speakers
  - Some of them will be happy to use the hack as an opportunity to publicise their own personal brands
- Ensure the topics of the workshops are relevant to the current interests of students

## Step 13. Final Touches
